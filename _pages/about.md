I am a fourth-year PhD student at the [**Institute of Computer Science**](http://www.ii.pw.edu.pl/ii_eng/Inst.-of-Computer-Science)
at the [**Warsaw University of Technology**](https://www.pw.edu.pl/engpw). I am working under the supervision of [Prof. T. Gambin](https://scholar.google.pl/citations?user=7yNxok4AAAAJ&hl=pl&oi=ao)
and [P. Andruszkiewicz](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/P.-Andruszkiewicz/3103504) on **Neural Machine Translation**, **Domain Adaptation**
and **Knowledge Graphs**. I am also interested in **Dependency Parsing** (working with the
[Linguistic Engineering Group](http://zil.ipipan.waw.pl/) @ ICS PAS).

Recently, I was a **Research Intern** at **Booking.com** working with the NMT team.

I have also done internships at **Google Zurich** and **Amazon Luxembourg**.
Additionally, I did a research visit at the [**StatMT**](http://www.statmt.org/ued/) team at the [**University of Edinburgh**](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics)
under the supervision of [Prof. A. Birch](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/abmayne/).
