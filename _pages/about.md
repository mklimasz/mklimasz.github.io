I am a Research Assistant and PhD student<sup>(thesis submitted)</sup> at the [**Institute of Computer Science**](http://www.ii.pw.edu.pl/ii_eng/Inst.-of-Computer-Science)
at the [**Warsaw University of Technology**](https://www.pw.edu.pl/engpw). I am working under the supervision of [Prof. T. Gambin](https://scholar.google.pl/citations?user=7yNxok4AAAAJ&hl=pl&oi=ao)
and [P. Andruszkiewicz](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/P.-Andruszkiewicz/3103504) on **Multilinguality** and **Modular Deep Learning**.

Recently, I was a Research Associate (PostDoc) at [**The University of Edinburgh**](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) in the [**StatMT**](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/statmt) 
group under the supervision of [A. Birch](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/abmayne/) (with whom I also worked during my research visits at UoE in 
2021 and 2023). I have also done internships at **Booking.com** (in the NMT Team), **Google Zurich** 
and **Amazon Luxembourg**.
